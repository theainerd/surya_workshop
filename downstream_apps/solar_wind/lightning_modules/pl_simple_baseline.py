pl_simple_baseline.py

A minimal PyTorch Lightning wrapper for training a flare prediction model.

This module defines a single LightningModule (FlareLightningModule) that:
  - Calls a user-provided PyTorch model on batched inputs (batch["ts"])
  - Computes one or more training/validation losses via a user-provided loss function
  - Logs scalar losses and evaluation metrics using Lightning's built-in logging
  - Configures a simple Adam optimizer

Intended use:
  - Provide a clean, readable baseline training loop in Lightning
  - Separate "model architecture" from "training mechanics"
  - Demonstrate how to log multiple losses/metrics consistently

Key batch contract:
  - batch["ts"]       : torch.Tensor input stack (e.g., [B, C, T, H, W])
  - batch["forecast"] : torch.Tensor target values (e.g., [B] or [B,])

Optional preprocessing:
  - If ``preprocess_fn`` is provided to ``__init__``, it is called on the batch dict
    before every model call. This is the intended hook for input transformations (such
    as inverse-normalizing SDO channels) that should not live inside the model.

Key metrics contract (the `metrics` dict passed to __init__):
  - metrics["train_loss"]    : callable(output, target) -> (loss_dict, weight_list)
        Backpropagated. Logged as "train_loss".
  - metrics["val_loss"]      : callable(output, target) -> (loss_dict, weight_list)
        Optional. Logged as "val_loss" and therefore what ModelCheckpoint monitors.
        Falls back to metrics["train_loss"] when absent.
  - metrics["train_metrics"] : callable(output, target) -> (metric_dict, weight_list)
  - metrics["val_metrics"]   : callable(output, target) -> (metric_dict, weight_list)
        Reported only. These do NOT affect checkpoint selection — "val_loss" does.

Where:
  - loss_dict / metric_dict map string names -> torch scalar tensors
  - weight_list is a list-like of floats (or tensors) aligned with the dict iteration order
    used by this baseline to form a weighted sum loss.

class FlareLightningModule(L.LightningModule):
    """
    PyTorch LightningModule for flare prediction training.

    This class wraps:
      (1) a user-provided PyTorch model (nn.Module-like) and
      (2) a set of loss/metric callables packaged in the `metrics` dictionary.

    Parameters
    ----------
    model:
        A callable model (typically torch.nn.Module) that accepts the batch input tensor
        `x = batch["ts"]` and returns predictions `output`.

    metrics:
        Dictionary containing the training loss function and metric functions.

        Required keys:
          - "train_loss": callable(output, target) -> (losses, weights)
              losses: dict[str, torch.Tensor] scalar losses
              weights: list-like aligned with iteration order of losses.keys()
          - "train_metrics": callable(output, target) -> (metrics, weights)
          - "val_metrics": callable(output, target) -> (metrics, weights)

        Optional key:
          - "val_loss": callable(output, target) -> (losses, weights)
              The validation objective. Defaults to "train_loss" when not supplied, so
              older metrics dicts keep working unchanged.

        The module uses:
          - train_loss in training_step, backpropagated and logged as "train_loss"
          - val_loss in validation_step, logged as "val_loss" — the quantity
            ModelCheckpoint monitors
          - train_metrics logged during training_step (if weights is non-empty)
          - val_metrics logged during validation_step (if weights is non-empty).
            Reported only; they do not influence checkpoint selection.

    lr:
        Learning rate for the Adam optimizer.

    batch_size:
        Optional batch size passed to Lightning's `self.log(..., batch_size=...)`.
        This improves correct averaging behavior when using distributed settings
        or variable batch sizes.

    preprocess_fn:
        Optional callable applied to the batch dict before every model call.
        Signature: ``(batch: dict) -> dict``. Use this to apply input
        transformations (e.g., ``destandardize_channels``) without
        embedding them in the model itself.
